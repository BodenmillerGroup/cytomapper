Title: Visualization of highly multiplexed imaging cytometry data in R
Description: 
    Highly multiplexed imaging cytometry acquires the single-cell expression of
    selected proteins in a spatially-resolved fashion. These measurements can be
    visualized across multiple length-scales. First, pixel-level intensities
    represent the spatial distributions of feature expression with highest
    resolution. Second, after segmentation, expression values or cell-level
    metadata (e.g. cell-type information) can be visualized on segmented cell
    areas. This package contains functions for the visualization of multiplexed
    read-outs and cell-level information obtained by multiplexed imaging
    cytometry. The main functions of this package allow 1. the visualization of
    pixel-level information across multiple channels and 2. the display of
    cell-level information (expression and/or metadata) on segmentation masks.
