Title: Visualization of highly multiplexed imaging data in R
Description: 
    Highly multiplexed imaging acquires the single-cell expression of
    selected proteins in a spatially-resolved fashion. These measurements can be
    visualised across multiple length-scales. First, pixel-level intensities
    represent the spatial distributions of feature expression with highest
    resolution. Second, after segmentation, expression values or cell-level
    metadata (e.g. cell-type information) can be visualised on segmented cell
    areas. This package contains functions for the visualisation of multiplexed
    read-outs and cell-level information obtained by multiplexed imaging
    technologies. The main functions of this package allow 1. the visualisation of
    pixel-level information across multiple channels, 2. the display of
    cell-level information (expression and/or metadata) on segmentation masks 
    and 3. gating and visualisation of single cells.
